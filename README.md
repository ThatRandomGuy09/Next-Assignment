## 📋 Assumptions Made  
- The Figma design provided only outlined the three pages; navigation between them was not specified, so a basic routing mechanism was implemented.
- All pages were built to be responsive and tested across different screen sizes.
- Content was filled in based on assumed placeholder data, as no explicit content details were mentioned.

## 📦 Dependencies  
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.  
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and better code maintainability.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient and responsive styling.
